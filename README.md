# Cricket-Analysis
This project aims to analyze cricket data to derive meaningful insights about players' performance and to suggest a strong final XI that can compete against any team in the world. The project involves web scraping, data preprocessing, and visualization using PowerBI.

## Project Workflow
Web Scraping: Data was scraped from a cricket website and saved into JSON files.
Data Preprocessing: Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, the data was cleaned, processed, and converted into CSV files.
Data Visualization: The processed data was uploaded to PowerBI to create interactive dashboards for analyzing batters, bowlers, and other metrics.
