# Cricket-Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze cricket data to derive meaningful insights about players' performance and to suggest a strong final XI that can compete against any team in the world. The project involves web scraping, data preprocessing, and visualization using PowerBI.

## Project Workflow
1. **Web Scraping**: Data was scraped from a cricket website "https://www.espncricinfo.com/" and saved into JSON files. The website was scrapped using an application Bright Data.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, the data was cleaned, processed, and converted into CSV files.
   
3. **Data Visualization**: The processed data was uploaded to PowerBI to create interactive dashboards for analyzing batters, bowlers, and other metrics. The csv files were loaded and transformed on PowerBI and various analysis were carried out based on several metrics.
   
4. **Final XI Selection**: Based on the analysis, a final XI team was suggested to form a strong lineup against any team in the world.
